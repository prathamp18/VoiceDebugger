# 🎙️ VoiceDebugger
*Debug and analyze your code using voice commands powered by OpenAI*

## 🚀 Overview
**VoiceDebugger** is an AI-powered tool that lets you **analyze, debug, and fix code** through **voice interaction**.  
Instead of manually pasting code into ChatGPT, you can simply **speak commands** like *“fix this code”* or *“analyze this snippet”*, and the tool will provide insights or corrected code.

This project combines:  
- 🎤 **Speech Recognition** (`speech_recognition`)  
- 🤖 **OpenAI GPT Models** (`openai`)  
- 🗣️ **Text-to-Speech** (`pyttsx3`)  

Making debugging more **interactive, efficient, and hands-free**.
